# High-resolution Network for Predicting Intratumoral Distribution of Nanoprobes

This project includes two deep learning models for predicting the intratumoral distribution of nanoprobes. These two models are GANDA and HRNet. The project contains two main folders: `GANDA` and `HRNet`, which include the implementation code and related resources for each model, respectively.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is quite large and cannot be stored directly on GitHub. Therefore, we have stored the data on an external cloud storage service. You can download the fold-1 data of the cross-validation from the following link:

- [Cross-validation fold-1 data](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApXhrLutwcz5jSOZ-SxemPX378U4)

Please download the data and extract it into the appropriate folder so that it can be accessed when running the code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
